# Throwing Candies

Physics-based puzzle video game for Android and iOS created in 2012 by Carlos And Ali.

## History:

Back in 2012, I started working at CIARA, gouvernamental entity in Caracas Venezuela, I met Ali, who was the most talented developer I had ever met, after a year working together, he convinced me to work on some projects in our spare time.

We bought 2 mac mini and started our brainstorming. After some time we had the idea of creating a puzzle game based on **Angry Birds** where we can throw something and **Cut The Rope** where the character eats a candy.

That's how **Throwing Candies** was born it was published in the AppStore and Playstore (not available anymore since we didn't mantain for new OS versions)
